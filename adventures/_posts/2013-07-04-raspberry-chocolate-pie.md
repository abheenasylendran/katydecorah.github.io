In honor of our nation's birth I accidentally made a semi-French dessert. Hmm... well. It was good. I mean real good.

Ok, it was time consuming. The crust is a Chocolate Pate Sucree, an ingredient that linked to another recipe (if you could have seen my face). However, it gave me a reason to say the name over and over again. You know, fancy words.
