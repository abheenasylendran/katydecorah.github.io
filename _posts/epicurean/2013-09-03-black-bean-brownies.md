Surprisingly amazing! The brownies didn't taste or have the texture of black beans.

The recipe requires you to whip everything up in a blender, making the whole process easy. However, I don't own a blender. I do have a small electric chopper. I threw a can of black bean in the chopper turning the beans into a paste. Next I mixed all the ingredients in the Kitchenaid. In no time the black beans smoothed out and the batter looked just like regular brownie batter.

Each brownie is about 125 calories. The recipe makes 16.
