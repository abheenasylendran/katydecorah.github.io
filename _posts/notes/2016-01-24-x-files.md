To celebrate the new X-Files episodes, I compiled a list of episodes that I often think about.

## [Tempus Fugit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempus_Fugit_(The_X-Files)) and [Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(The_X-Files)) &mdash; every time I fly

When boarding a flight, attendants rattle off credit cards and rewards programs giving members an opportunity to board first. They have corny names like *SkyMiles* and *Star Alliance* and for some reason all I can think about is:

## [Irresistible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irresistible_(The_X-Files)) and [Orison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orison_(The_X-Files)) &mdash; every time I get my nails done

Donnie Pfaster is a serial killer who fetishizes over women with red nail polish and prefers natural redheads. He's the ultimate creep, I mean look:

## [Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_(The_X-Files)) &mdash; every time I have a ringing in my ear.

Bryan Cranston must drive west to keep the pressure in his ear from exploding his head. Gruesome? Sure. But Bryan Cranston makes this episode one of my favorites.

## [Never Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Again_(The_X-Files)) &mdash; every time I get mansplained

This Scully-tastic episode includes her meeting a new guy with some issues (re: he thinks that his tattoo is compelling him kill and stuff). At the end of the episode, an exhausted Scully remarks:

## [Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_(The_X-Files)) &mdash; every time I see an LED screen

In this episode, electronics compel people to kill. As a result, I'm sometimes suspicious of my Fitbit's random words of encouragement.

## [Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_(The_X-Files)) &mdash; every time I hear "Wonderful! Wonderful!"

A creepy inbred family murders in effort to keep family inbred (to the crooning of Johnny Mathis).

## [The Host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Host_(The_X-Files)) &mdash; every time I think I'm going to enjoy a bath

A gross flatworm monster slithers through drains and attacks. This is one of the scariest monsters, so I'm not including an image.
