Dribbble shot [Ice Cream Pattern by Dorottya Porkolab](http://dribbble.com/shots/1294320-Ice-Cream-Pattern)

For this pen, I made each ice cream a single element. I used `border-top` for the pink section, `border-bottom` for the green section, and background for the yellow section. The inner ice cream shadow is a `:before` and the stick is an `:after`.

I rotated the ice cream bars using the nth-child selector, but more specifically calling out odd and even.

I applied a width to the body to ensure that the pattern stays inline. Then I hid the overflow to keep the pattern tight against the browser.

I partially made this because I felt that I needed to redeem myself with something light and happy after creating [this morbid pen](http://codepen.io/katydecorah/pen/Lkogi) in honor of Halloween.
