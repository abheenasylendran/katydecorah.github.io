I love using Google Fonts. I know webfonts are a killer for web performance, but I can't help myself. I tend to start designing something based on the font. I do this because I tend to lean heavy on ems as a unit for measure and for dictating my proportions in my design. Call it process, call it whatever, I just love a good font.

I am, however, not a huge fan of the Google Font interface. I wish I could search more font types more specifically. The dummy text the use to preview fonts never seems accurate. I find myself having to try on different fonts like I'm in a dressing room. 

I created the Google Font Explorer to find new fonts and test them out a little more accurately.

I'm tapping into Google's Font API to access all the font families data. So you can type in a font to try it out. I used Bootstrap's typeahead to help you find the font as you type. You can also click the randomize button to view a totally new font. You can edit the dummy or use the lorem ipsum text provided. Learn more about the font by click the information button. I also provided a history list in case you want to go back to a previously viewed font.
