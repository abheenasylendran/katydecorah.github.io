After creating the [CSS Diamond](diamond.html) I tried to replicate [this Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/shots/1179097-Bloombox). I created a list item for each petal. They are all ovals with transparent border-left and border-right and then rotated respectively.

I starting playing around with the animation and was pleased with my result. If you view on CodePen the animation is infinite.
