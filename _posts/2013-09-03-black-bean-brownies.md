Surprisingly amazing. Didn't have the taste or texture of black beans.

I don't have a blender, only a small electric chopper. I was able to use the small chopper to turn the black beans into a paste. Then I threw the rest of the ingredients into the Kitchenaid along with the black beans. In no time the black beans smoothed out and it looked just like brownie batter.

Around 125 calories per brownie (16 brownies in a batch).
