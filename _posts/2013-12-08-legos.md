On Saturday, I was a reviewer for the Junior FIRST LEGO League Expo hosted at the University at Albany. The Expo is a big celebration for children ages 6 to 9, who through research and legos work in teams to solve a real world problem. The teams bring their projects to the Expo to show off their hard work. During the high-five ceremony at the end of the Expo, the teams receive a trophy and each team member receives a certificate and medal. This year's theme was *Disaster Blaster*, creating technologies to help against natural disasters.

As a reviewer, I met with four teams and had 15 minutes with each to talk about their projects. I had so much fun asking them questions about what they made, how they researched, and how they worked together.

It's a really special day for the children, the organizers, and the volunteers.

That night was caught the Phantogram show at Upstate Concert Hall. They played a really good set.

On Sunday, we grabbed a quick and delicious breakfast at the Skyline Diner in Rensselaer. 

Later on I needed a pick-me-up from this cold weather so I made teal icing for lemon sugar cookies.
