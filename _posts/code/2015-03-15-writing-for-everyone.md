On Thursday, I gave my talk [Writing for everyone](http://katydecorah.com/writing-for-everyone/) at [FOSS4G NA](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/). You can click through my slides below or follow along with [my notes](http://katydecorah.com/writing-for-everyone/notes/).

The slides are built with [Big](http://www.macwright.org/big/) and Jekyll. At first I was just going to work in a flat HTML file, but then I got the itch.

Directories! Pages! Organization! Front-matter! Logic!

I wove Big into Jekyll and came up with a nice workflow. Each slide is a Jekyll post. I organized sections into folders. I used front matter properties to organize slide styles. Oh and that notes page up top? That's pulling each slide/posts `notes` data from the front matter. Pretty handy. [Check out the repo](https://github.com/katydecorah/writing-for-everyone).

The week before the talk, I didn't want to give it. I was really nervous. I was worried my talk wouldn't catch with anyone. But I think I experienced the best possible outcome. I had an awesome and encouraging audience and then some of my heroes tweeted out my slides before I had a chance to. Amazing :purple_heart:. Thank you!
