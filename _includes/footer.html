			<p>Hi, I'm Katy DeCorah.</p>
			<p>I taught myself HTML and CSS in middle school, but pursued history and classics in college because I didn't think I was technical enough. I went to graduate school to become a librarian and left a web developer. Now I think I'm technical enough, well most days.</p>
