[Warby Parker](http://www.warbyparker.com/) sells eyewear and provides a free at home try-on of frames for 5 days. The service is completely free and easy.

Warby Parker's website has a large, diverse selection with excellent photos of each frame at different angles. I spent a good amount of time picking and choosing, but I was able to find (at least) 5 frames that I wanted to try. Unfortunately, a few frames I wanted to try were out being tried on by other customers. I submitted my order, where I had to put my credit card on file, but I wasn't charged.

A few days later, I received this beautiful box in the mail. The shipping was free and they even provided paid return postage.

After trying them all on, I found that I liked the [Durand in Saddle Russet](http://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses/women/durand#saddle-russet) best. However, the [Chamberlain in Whiskey Tortoise](http://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses/women/chamberlain#whiskey-tortoise) was a close second. After I packed up the box and shipped it back, I ordered the frames I loved online. It was very easy to order and with no surprise charges. I didn't have my prescription on hand, but Warby Parker offered to contact my doctor for me.

I got my glasses and I am very happy with my purchase.
