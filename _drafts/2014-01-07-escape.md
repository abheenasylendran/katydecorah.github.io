Another single element project, this time it's modeled after the Dribbble shot []().

The main element, `.marker`, is the map marker shape. The `:before` is the inner circles and the `:after` is the dial.

The marker shape is acheived by using a `border-radius: 100% 100% 0;`. I then rotated the element 45 degrees, to sit up right. I used a gradient for the two-toned look of the background.

I created the white inner circle by using the `:before` element. I used inset `box-shadows` to achieve the inner rings. I used another gradient for the two-toned look of the background.

I used the `:after` element to create the dial. I started with a rectangle, that I skewed and rotated. I kind of squashed the rectangle, until it elongated into the dial shape. With the `height` and `width` set to 0, I relied on `border` to color in each side of the dial, which added more dimension to the element.
