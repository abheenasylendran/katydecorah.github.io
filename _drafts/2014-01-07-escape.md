Another single element project, this time it's modeled after the Dribbble shot []().

The main element, `.marker`, is the map marker shape. The `:before` is the inner circles and the `:after` is the dial.

The marker shape is acheived by using a `border-radius: 100% 100% 0;`. I rotated the element 45 degrees, to make it sit on its point. I used a gradient for the two-toned look of the background.

I used the `:before` element for the inner background. To achieve the white and gray circles, I used inset `box-shadows`. I used another gradient for the two-toned look of the background.

I used the `:after` element for the dial. First, I created a rectangle using `border` to manipulate the shape. I used border because the dial is four-toned and I can set each border side to a different color. Next, I skewed and rotated the element. I skewed it until I squashed the height and elongated the width.
