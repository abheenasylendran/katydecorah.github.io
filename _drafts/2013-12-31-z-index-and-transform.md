I wanted to create this Dribbble shot as a single element, but I was presented with a few challenges.

1. Give the ribbon tail a shadow, without adding extra elements.
2. Make the main element transform, without losing the stacking order.

## Give the ribbon tail a shadow

I first tried a triangle, but found that the angles didn't match up so nice.

Then at last, a trapezoid popped into my head.
