This recipe was [adapted from Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/homemade-black-bean-veggie-burgers/). 

I doubled and adjusted the cooking methods for this delicious recipe. I use a standard 12-cup cupcake tin to bake the burgers in for portion control. Leftovers keep in the fridge for up to one week.

## Ingredients

* 2 (16 ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 green bell pepper, chopped
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 tablespoon minced garlic
* 2 eggs
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 2 tablespoons cumin
* 1 tablespoons Sriracha
* 1 cup bread crumbs

## Directions

1. Preheat over to 375 degrees, lightly oil standard cupcake tin.
2. In standing mixer bowl, combine black beans, bell pepper, onion, minced garlic, and eggs. Turn mixer on medium-low until mixture begins to smooth.
3. Add chili powder, cumin, and Sriracha. 
4. Mix until well combined. The black beans should be well mashed.
5. Stir in bread crumbs.
6. Spoon drop black bean mixture into cupcake tin. Pack firmly and fill to the rim.
7. Bake for 20 minutes.

Instead of a bun, I like to use large lettuce leaves. I will also make fancy sauce (Sriracha + Mayo) to top the burger. A fresh sliced tomato and avocado are great toppers as well.
