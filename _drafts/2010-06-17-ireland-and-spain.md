<p class="lead pop-out">On January 4, 2014, I found an old notebook containing a list of things I did on my trip to Ireland and Spain in 2010. A friend from college was finishing her Masters at UCD, I visited for two weeks along with a friend she met abroad and another friend from college.</p>

This was my first overseas flight alone and first overseas trip without guidance.  It was fun to read this list. I remember many of these items vividly, while others I don't remember at all. 

While this list appears to be thorough, I know I left out a certain trip to McDonald's, we vowed to never speak of it, after having very light tapas in Barcelona. I remember using a promotional map I found in the Barcelona airport to get us around. I remember how kind other passengers on the Metro in Spain were to us as my friend was on crutches. I remember being nervous once I landed in Dublin, but the bus driver made sure I knew where I was going. I remember the waiter in Spain asking us if we like 'soccer,' but I thought he was saying 'saki', and how confused everyone was during that conversation. I remember leaving my wallet in my mom's car after she dropped me off the gate and realizing it after I got through security. I remember dripping with sweat as we climbed up to Park Gru&uuml;ll with our backpacks. I remember being the only ones not partying at the Barcelona hostel because we wanted to get up early. I remember one of us lost our bus ticket in Barcelona back to the airport, it was the last bus of the day and the clock was ticking. We narrowly squeezed on the bus. I remember searching for a claddagh ring in Ireland and found one in Blarney that I still wear every single day.

This was a really good trip.
