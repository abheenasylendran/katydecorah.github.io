I recently came across the website for the app [THREES](http://asherv.com/threes/). One of my favorite parts of the website is at the very bottom. As you scroll, the phone glides down the page and ends up in a pocket, where an app store button awaits you.

I loved the button, so I wanted to try it out in CSS. It's scalable and color change friendly.

The dimension of the button and button's shadow are both `box-shadow`.
