Morph, `.morph`, is a single element and its pseudo element, `:before`. Both elements are styled very similiarly; tear drop shaped using `border-radius` where all values equal 100%, except the inner side is 40%.

## .morph
I needed to get each sharp side to touch. I rotated `.morph` 45degrees to make it's sharpest side point east. I didn't want to have to rotate this element, but it seemed like the only way to get the shapes positioned the way I wanted them. My oppoistion is that now I'm coding at a 45 degree angle. Put your right ear to your right shoulder; that's how I'm coding. On and off I commented out the `transform` on `.morph` so as to not confuse myself.

As far as size, I decided that `.morph` would use `$size` and then `:before` would use `$little`, a fraction of `$size`.

## :before
I had the first element in position, but now I needed to persuade `:before` to point its sharp side west and touch `.morph`.
