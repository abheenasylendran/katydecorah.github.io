## Good Recipes

I baked and cooked a lot this weekend, here are the recipes I recommend:

* [sriracha kale chips](http://www.marthastewart.com/352650/chili-sauce-kale-chips)
* [french onion soup](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-french-onion-soup/d65052eb-0516-452c-88a0-978301ca1d5d) 
* [chocolate ice cream](http://www.marthastewart.com/354894/chocolate-ice-cream). I upped my ice cream game after I bought [cardboard pint containers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00381DIR0) on Amazon.

## MBerry

Saturday night, my boyfriend and I experimented with [mberry](http://mberry.us/). Mberry is a tablet that you dissolve on your tongue that will alter your tasetbuds. So a lemon wedge, that is normally sour, tastes so pleasantly sweet!

Here are a few items we sampled.

It was really fun, but some foods were just too sicky-sweet. I liked the lemon and the lime the best.
