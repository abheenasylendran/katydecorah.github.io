I saw this great Dribble shot of a simple logo. The thing that caught my eye was the absense of the bottom-right corner. I needed to try this out. 

## .gesund
The project is a single element, using `.gesund`, as the gray square. The `:before` element is the circle and the `:after` camouflages the bottom-right corner.

And thanks to college German for understanding the title. Jawohl!
